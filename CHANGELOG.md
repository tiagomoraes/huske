# Changelog

All notable changes to huske will be documented in this file.

This project uses semantic versioning after the first public release.

## Unreleased

- Nothing yet.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Update check on startup. Prints a stderr banner when a newer release is on
  PyPI, with the upgrade command tailored to the install method
  (`uv tool upgrade huske`, `pipx upgrade huske`, or `brew upgrade huske`).
  The check is cached for 24 h, runs in a background thread, is silent for
  editable installs and non-TTY stderr, and can be disabled with
  `HUSKE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

## 0.1.0

### Added

- Initial always-on macOS terminal recorder.
- Microphone and system audio capture.
- Local transcription through faster-whisper.
- Day-organized Markdown transcript output.
- Recovery for orphaned audio chunks.
- Rich terminal UI and setup doctor.
- Open source project structure: license, contribution guide, code of conduct,
  security policy, support guide, issue templates, PR template, and CI.
